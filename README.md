"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this lab is to continue the design of an
elementary central processing unit (CPU) that was started in
Lab 4. In part 1 of this lab, a 2-bit instruction field will be
used to control a simple state machine that in turn will be
used to set the MUX lines in the RALU (registers and ALU)
according to what type of instruction is designated for
execution. In part 2, a 3-bit instruction field will be used.
You will also add a program counter (PC) and a memory
module to store the instructions of a “program” to be
executed by the CPU." - Dr. Eric Schwartz, UF course 3701
